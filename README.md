# NeuroShield
This repository provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing, detecting, and mitigating adversarial attacks on neural networks. It includes utilities for identifying suspicious neurons, fine-tuning models to improve robustness, and evaluating the modified models. The project is built with PyTorch and integrates popular adversarial-attack libraries such as torchattacks.
